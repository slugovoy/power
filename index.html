                <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts:
                    squat, bench press, and deadlift.</p>
                <p>As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single
                    lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.</p>
                <p>Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format
                    but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>There are two types depending on equipment used: conventional stand and monolift stand. In case of
                    the former lift is called walked out squat and in case of the latter lift is called monolift squat.
                </p>
                <p>Most powerlifting federations allow for monolift squats. The ones that do not are the IPF, IPL and
                    the WDFPF.</p>
                <p>The lift starts with the lifter standing erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the
                    lifter's shoulders. At the referee's command the lift begins. The lifter creates a break in the
                    hips, bends their knees and drops into a squatting position with the hip crease (the top surface of
                    the leg at the hip crease) below the top of the knee. The lifter then returns to an erect position.
                    At the referee's command the bar is returned to the rack and the lift is completed.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>With his or her back resting on the bench, the lifter takes the loaded bar at arm's length. The
                    lifter lowers the bar to the chest. When the bar becomes motionless on the chest, the referee gives
                    a press command. Then the referee will call 'Rack' and the lift is completed as the weight is
                    returned to the rack.</p>

                <p>In the deadlift the athlete grasps the loaded bar which is resting on the platform floor. The lifter
                    pulls the weights off the floor and assumes an erect position. The knees must be locked and the
                    shoulders back, with the weight held in the lifter's grip. At the referee's command the bar will be
                    returned to the floor under the control of the lifter.</p>
